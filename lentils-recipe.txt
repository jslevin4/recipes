Lentils, rice and vegetable stew

Ingredients:
 - about 1/2 a small broccoli floret (?)
 - 1/2 medium sized onion
 - 1/2 red potato
 - 1/2 cup lentils (green/brown)
 - 1/2 cup brown rice
 - 2 cups water
 - dash curry powder
 - dash pepper
 - other spices, salt, to taste
 
Directions:
 1. Put 2 cups water in a medium saucepan.  Add lentils and rice.
    Set heat to medium-high (6-7 on a burner that goes to 10).  Can also add some
    spices at this point, like curry powder.
	
 2. Chop half a broccoli floret into small pieces, even use stems, add to pot.
    Remove ends and peel onion, and divide in half.  Chop half an onion and add to
    pot. 

 3. Reduce heat (do this every once in a while, until heat is at a simmer),
    and stir occasionally.
 
 4. Chop a medium red potato in half and chop into small pieces, add to pot.
 
 5. Add some spices to taste: curry powder, pepper, maybe chili powder.  
 
 6. If heat is not already on low/simmer, put it there.  Cover pot.
 
 7. Uncover and stir once in a while.
 
 8. When it looks like most of the water is gone, and the rice seems about done.
    Turn off heat.  Stir, cover pan, and allow to cool down a bit.
	
 9. Enjoy lentil stew with bread or whatever you prefer (maybe a hamburger)
